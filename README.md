# ScanSwarm

A token analysis system built on the [Swarms Framework](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms), utilizing multi-agent architecture for automated crypto token screening.

## Framework Integration
ScanSwarm leverages the Swarms Framework for:
- 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration
- 🔄 Sequential Workflows
- 📊 Distributed Analysis
- 🧠 Agent Communication

## Agent Architecture
Built using Swarms' agent patterns:
\\\python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

class NavigatorAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            agent_name="Navigator",
            system_prompt="Specialized navigation agent for token analysis",
            model_name="gpt-4"
        )
\\\

## Swarms Integration
- Uses Swarms' SequentialWorkflow for agent coordination
- Implements Swarms' Agent class for each specialized component
- Follows Swarms' communication patterns
- Leverages Swarms' error handling
